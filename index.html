                <p class="fs-400">Cord-cutting is becoming a huge thing these days. People around the world are tired of paying the massive bills associated with cable TV and the subscriptions of Netflix and other streaming platforms. The good news is that sites like Fmovies are making cord-cutting possible. They offer free movies and TV shows for all people around the world. But as you can imagine, things have not been smooth. Fmovies and others like it have been targeted by relevant authorities for piracy and copyright infringement. But nonetheless, they still offer a great streaming option.</p>

                <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading fw-bold text-primary-400">What is Fmovies?</h2>
                <p class="fs-400">As noted above, Fmovies is a file-sharing website that allows people to watch a wide range of movies and TV shows for free. The site has several categories and a wide variety of content. Although it has been frustrated by copyright authorities in many countries around the world, there are still so many Fmovies clone sites that are offering access to this content. The origin of Fmovies is also unknown and no one knows where the sites are hosted. This makes it a very hard target for law enforcement.</p>
                
                <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading fw-bold text-primary-400">The History of Fmovies</h2>
                <p class="fs-400">Fmovies has had a very troubled history. It’s even a surprise that the site is still here today. The site was created in 2016. It became quite popular within a few months but it faced its first setback later that year. In December 2016, Google announced that it had blocked Fmovies from its search results. But things did not end there. Fmovies was also sued by a Filipino media organization for piracy and was ordered to pay $210, 000 in damages. But despite these challenges, Fmovies continued to operate and kept serving millions of streamers from all over the world. This attracted the attention of the US government and in 2018, Fmovies was identified by the US as one of the most “notorious” platforms for sharing pirated materials. The site was later reported by the Motion Picture Association of America to the US government but nothing further happened after that. Despite this, Fmovies is blocked in so many countries. Australia was the first major market to block Fmovies after the decision was made in 2018. India, Sweden, Denmark have also followed suit. But even with these efforts, there are still several Fmovies sites that are running. If you suspect that the site may be blocked in your country, do not worry. There is a way around this and we will show you below.</p>

                <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading fw-bold text-primary-400">How to Access Fmovies from Anywhere?</h2>
                <p class="fs-400">Because of the action taken by anti-piracy government bodies, accessing Fmovies has become quite a challenge for so many people. But this is one of the best streaming platforms out there, and as such, it is worth doing whatever you can to explore its content. Well, there is actually one simple way of accessing Fmovies from anywhere in the world. Simply use a VPN. A VPN is designed to mask your IP and route your traffic to a different server. Let’s say for example you are in Australia, one of the few countries where Fmovies is blocked. When you install a VPN on your device, you can route your traffic to a US server. The US is one of the countries where access to Fmovies is still not an issue. Once you have done that, it would appear you are accessing Fmovies from the US and as such, you will not face the blockade put in place in your country. Using a VPN also helps to protect your privacy and keep you safe online.</p>

                <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading fw-bold text-primary-400">What Are the Pros of Using Fmovies?</h2>
                <p class="fs-400">Despite its legal challenges over the years, Fmovies has managed to offer excellent value to its fans out there. The site has a lot of pros. First, there is a superb variety of content. This is always a huge factor when you are gauging the quality of a streaming site. After all, the last thing you want is to go to a website only to realize that there aren’t many movies you are interested in. The Fmovies site, even though it has used different domains over the years, also looks quite sleek and so easy to use. You can locate whatever you want to watch in a matter of minutes. You will also be happy to note that the website has a superb trust rating. In essence, a majority of people who use it don’t often land into any issues. This, therefore, means the site is relatively safe to use but it is always nice to take precautions. Finally, Fmovies is updated very regularly. New shows and movies will always be available on the site as soon as possible.</p>

                <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading fw-bold text-primary-400">Can You Use Fmovies on a Smart TV?</h2>
                <p class="fs-400">Yes, as long as you have the browser to do it. Unlike other streaming services, Fmovies does not have an official app. Yes, there are some apps that claim to be Fmovies but most of them are not genuine. The best way would be to just stream directly on your smart TV’s browser. In case you have a streaming device like a Firestick or an android TV box, consider getting a suitable browser to help you access Fmovies.</p>

                <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading fw-bold text-primary-400">Should I Be Worried If I Have Used Fmovies Before?</h2>
                <p class="fs-400">No, you should not be worried at all. Although most domains associated with Fmovies have either been seized or blocked by authorities, users like you are still untouchable. Besides, copyright laws are very different from one country to the next. Enforcing them is, therefore, a huge challenge. In most cases, anti-piracy bodies will focus more on stopping the streaming of pirated content than catching the people doing it. But since there have been many fake Fmovies sites, chances are you may have landed in one of them. Just as a precaution, ensure you do regular scans on your device to check if there is any malware to remove. But moving forward, always use VPNs when streaming pirated materials. It’s just a common-sense decision that goes a long way in protecting you.</p>
     
                <p class="fs-400">Nevertheless fmovies only store links which then points to the data on internet. Fmovies does not store any content or video on its own server and only links to it.</p>
